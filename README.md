# Web Enabled Information Systems Final Project

## Class Background
ICT 4300 - Web Enabled Information Systems is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology. The course emphasizes database design and object-oriented modeling methods, including use cases, class, and activity diagrams that describe the informational and behavioral content of a web application's objects.

## Project Information
My project is a mockup of a fictitious stock-image sharing application. A working website was beyond the scope of the assignment. The project examines the object interaction life cycle from the client- to server-side, primarily through entity relationship diagrams. This map of user interactions and data encapsulation provides a roadmap to begin working on a real-world web application.
